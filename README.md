# Etch-a-Sketch

This repository contains an interactive grid that mimics the functionality of an Etch-a-Sketch toy.

## Features

- A grid of div elements is generated based on a specified size.
- The grid size can be adjusted by clicking a button and entering a new size.
- Hovering over the grid cells changes their background color to a randomly generated color.
